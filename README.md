# WHO-Life-Expectancy-Analysis


The Life Expectancy Analysis project is a data-driven initiative that leverages extensive datasets provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) to explore and gain insights into factors influencing life expectancy across the globe. This project delves into the intricate interplay of various socio-economic, healthcare, and environmental variables on the longevity of populations.

Through advanced data analytics and statistical modeling, the project seeks to answer key questions about the factors contributing to disparities in life expectancy between countries and regions. It aims to identify trends, correlations, and potential causal relationships, shedding light on the determinants of health and well-being worldwide.

By conducting a comprehensive analysis, this project not only provides a better understanding of global health outcomes but also offers valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. The outcomes of this project contribute to evidence-based decision-making and the formulation of strategies to improve the quality of life and increase life expectancy in various populations.
